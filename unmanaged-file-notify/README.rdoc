== Unmanaged files and notification

A common question in the #puppet irc channel on freenode is: "How can I have puppet notify a service when I manually update a file?"

While I believe this "manual update" portion is an antipattern, in some cases (development server, whatever) it is desirable.

The code in this directory implements it. The gist of it is that you have
puppet copy a local file and notify when that copy occurs.
