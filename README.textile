h1. Puppet Examples

This project aims to document and demonstrate several uses of puppet.

The main goal is to have a repository for me to publish any practical puppet
patterns I find useful. I also will put some more esoteric and experimental
tricks and hacks here. Lastly, I will try to put common "how to" answers that I
find asked in the #puppet IRC channel (on freenode).

h2. What do we have?

h3. Practical

* exported-expiration - an example of how to expire exported resources that
  haven't checked in recently.
* nodeless-puppet - a method for managing puppet nodes purely through facts and
  properties. No 'node' definitions, no external node classifier, etc.

h3. FAQ

* unamanged-file-notify - FAQ: "How do I notify a service (or other resource)
  when I manually update a config file?"
* stages-example - FAQ: "How do I use stages?" or "Stages aren't working for me"

h3. Experimental

* manage-remote-hack: Manage remote servers with puppet - this hack tricks puppet into doing
  package mangement over ssh, allowing you to manage remote servers that do not
  have puppet (or ruby) installed.
